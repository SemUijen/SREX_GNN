## Graph Neural Network for optimizing Hybrid Genetic Search

This repository contains the code of my thesis, which delved into optimizing the hybrid genetic search algorithm([Vidal (2022)][1]).  
For this thesis, the [PyVRP][2] implementation of Hybrid Genetic Search was used.

> [!TIP]
> If you are new to vehicle routing or metaheuristics, the PyVRP library perfectly explains the basics on their website: [introduction to VRP][3] and [introduction to HGS][4].
