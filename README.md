## Graph Neural Network for optimizing Hybrid Genetic Search

This repository contains the code of my thesis, which delved into optimizing the hybrid genetic search algorithm ([Vidal (2022)][1]). For this thesis, the [PyVRP][2] implementation of Hybrid Genetic Search was used.

> If you are new to vehicle routing or metaheuristics, the PyVRP library perfectly explains the basics on their website: [introduction to VRP][3] and [introduction to HGS][4].

## Abstract

In recent years, the paradigm Learn to Optimize is making strive in learning how to solve combinatorial optimization problem using machine learning. Most models still get out-performed by the state-of-the-art algorithms, so If you canâ€™t beat them, why not just join them? \
Hybrid Genetic Search(HGS) is one of these state-of-the-art algorithms. Eventhough HGS is state-of-the-art, it still leaves room for increasing efficiency due to its many random aspects, among which is the crossover step. Many studies have used operator selection or parameter adaption methods to address this randomness. Doing direct local genetic selection is less studied.\
To fill this gap, we propose NeuroSREX, which utilizes Selective Route Exchange (SREX) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to select specific route(s) of each parent to crossover. While NeuroSREX is not yet practically viable due to difficulties in dealing with constraints and the added computation time, our results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model.\
Meaning, we found lower cost solutions in less iterations than HGS. We outperformed HGS on a multitude of instances, taking the first step in the evolution of optimizing evolution.

### The Proposed model

Figure 1 illustrates the model proposed in this thesis. The architecture comprises three main elements: [the Graph Attention (GAT)](5) networks, the embedding transformations, and, finally, the fully-connected (FC) layers.

</br>
The single input for the model consists of three different graphs: Parent-1 and Parent-2 which both represent a single solution to a VRP-problems, and the Full Graph which represent the whole VRP-problem graph(i.e. all edges and nodes of the problem).

The output for a single input, shown in figure 2, is heatmap showing the estimated best configuration of the Selective Route Exchange Crossover function given Parent-1 and Parent-2.
