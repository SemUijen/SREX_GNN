## Abstract

In recent years, the paradigm Learn to Optimize is making strive in learning how to solve combinatorial optimization problem using machine learning. Most models still get out-performed by the state-of-the-art algorithms, so If you canâ€™t beat them, why not just join them? \
Hybrid Genetic Search(HGS) is one of these state-of-the-art algorithms. Eventhough HGS is state-of-the-art, it still leaves room for increasing efficiency due to its many random aspects, among which is the crossover step. Many studies have used operator selection or parameter adaption methods to address this randomness. Doing direct local genetic selection is less studied.\
To fill this gap, we propose NeuroSREX, which utilizes Selective Route Exchange (SREX) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to select specific route(s) of each parent to crossover. While NeuroSREX is not yet practically viable due to difficulties in dealing with constraints and the added computation time, the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the model.\
Meaning, we found lower cost solutions in less iterations than HGS. We outperformed HGS on a multitude of instances, taking the first step in the evolution of optimizing evolution.

### The Proposed model

Figure 1 illustrates the model proposed in this thesis. The architecture comprises three main elements: [the Graph Attention (GAT)](5) networks, the embedding transformations, and, finally, the fully-connected (FC) layers.

    <div class="overlay">Figure 1: Diagram of proposed model</div>

</br>
The single input for the model consists of three different graphs: Parent-1 and Parent-2 which both represent a single solution to a VRP-problems, and the Full Graph which represent the whole VRP-problem graph(i.e. all edges and nodes of the problem).

The output for a single input, shown in figure 2, is heatmap showing the estimated best configuration of the Selective Route Exchange Crossover function given Parent-1 and Parent-2.

## Conclusion

When integrated into the Hybrid Genetic Search, the NeuroSREX model approach exhibited potential for enhancing solution quality given enough iterations(30.000+). However, significant compute overhead was introduced through requiring positional encodings([LapPE][6]) for every solution. Addressing this limitation to improve iteration speed remains imperative for practical viability.\
In conclusion, we have taken the first steps toward optimizing genetic selection within the context of routing problems. While it is not currently ready for practical implementation, this study has demonstrated a significant positive impact, warranting further exploration in the optimization of evolutionary algorithms. As with natural evolution, progress is achieved on step at a time.

## Future Work

To create practical viability, we recommend the following steps for future work in order of importance:

- Improve the current implementation by adding positional encodings as a feature to every solution. This would eliminate the need to calculate it repeatedly.
- Train NeuroSREX using an alternative approach for computing the Positional Embeddings: compute the eigenvector for each graph edge, incorporating them as edge features, and subsequently deriving Node PEs based on the Parent Graph edges. This method requires calculating eigenvectors only once for each route instance before running HGS.

- If the aforementioned steps result in practical viability for instances with less challenging constraints, subsequent research efforts should focus on developing methods to incorporate the capability to handle more complex constraints.
